#+TITLE: Steven McCord's Dotfile

* Overview
The purpose of this repo is to store local configuration for various development tools that I utilize.

* Install
To install the dotfiles on your local machine you just need to run the following command:

~. bin/install~

This will install the following configuration files:

+ .zshrc
+ .gitconfig
+ .gitignore-globals
+ spacemacs configuration
+ spacemacs personal layer configuration

** iTerm2 Preferences/Profiles

In order to bring in the configuration for iTerm2, you will need to go into your
preferences and check the boxes "Load preferences from a custom folder or URL"
as well as the "Save changes to folder when iTerm2 quits".
